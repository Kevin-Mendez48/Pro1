Git Basics

1. To create a folder, we use 'mk dir' and name is 'learn_git_again'
2. To change directories we use 'cd' and we jump into 'learn_git_again'
3. To create a file we use 'touch' and name the file 'third.txt'
4. To initialize an empty git repository we use 'git init'
5. To add a file to the staging area we use 'git add' and take the file 'third.txt'
6. To commit, we use 'git commit' with the flag '-m' which gives it a message and we put "adding third.txt"
7. You can check your commit with 'git log'
8. We now create another file using 'touch' and name is 'fourth.txt'
9. We add this to the staging area also using 'git add' coupled with 'fourth.txt
10. Now we commit with a message 'git commit -m' with the message' adding fourth.txt'
11. To remove a file we use 'rm' and chose the file 'third.txt'
12. To add this change to the staging area we use 'git add' with the name of the file 'third.txt'
13. Now we commit it 'git commit -m' with the message ' removing third.txt'
14. we check out log again using 'git log'
15. For this step we are to change the global setting to core.pager=cat using 'git config' with '--global core.pager cat'
16. Now we can list all the configurations we have done on git using 'git config' with '--global' and '--list'
